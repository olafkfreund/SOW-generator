Cloud Migration and Modernization Project

Project Overview:
This project involves migrating our on-premises infrastructure to a modern cloud platform 
while modernizing legacy applications for improved scalability, performance, and cost efficiency.
The migration will be executed in phases to minimize business disruption.

Key Objectives:
• Migrate 50+ applications to AWS cloud infrastructure
• Modernize legacy monolithic applications to microservices
• Implement DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines
• Reduce infrastructure costs by 30-40%
• Improve application performance and scalability
• Enhance security posture with cloud-native security services

Technical Approach:
Assessment Phase: Comprehensive analysis of current infrastructure, applications, 
and dependencies. Performance baseline establishment and cloud readiness assessment.

Migration Strategy: Lift-and-shift for compatible applications, re-architecting 
for critical business applications, and retirement of legacy systems.

Modernization: Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, microservices 
architecture implementation, and API-first design principles.

Security: Implementation of Zero Trust security model, encryption at rest 
and in transit, and compliance with industry standards.

Project Timeline:
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Assessment, planning, and cloud environment setup
Phase 2 (Weeks 7-18): Infrastructure migration and basic application deployment
Phase 3 (Weeks 19-30): Application modernization and optimization
Phase 4 (Weeks 31-36): Testing, optimization, and go-live preparation
Phase 5 (Weeks 37-40): Final migration, validation, and knowledge transfer

Success Metrics:
• Zero data loss during migration
• Application downtime less than 4 hours per service
• 30% reduction in infrastructure operational costs
• 50% improvement in deployment frequency
• 99.9% application availability post-migration
• Complete compliance with security and regulatory requirements

- Real-time streaming data processing
- Batch data processing capabilities
- Data validation and quality checks
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Data Processing
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
- Data cleansing and normalization
- Data transformation and enrichment
- Historical data archiving
- Data lineage tracking

### Analytics Engine
- SQL query engine for ad-hoc analysis

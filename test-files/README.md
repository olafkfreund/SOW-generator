3. **No Output Generated:** Check the browser console for errors
4. **Backend Issues:** Ensure the backend server is running on port 5000

## Next Steps

After testing with these files, you can:
- Create your own project requirement files
- Modify existing test files to match your specific needs
- Test the management dashboard features (engineers, calendar, pricing)
- Explore the export functionality (PDF/DOCX)

API Development and Integration Project

Project Description:
Development of a comprehensive RESTful API system to integrate multiple third-party services and provide unified access to our application ecosystem.

Scope of Work:

1. API Design and Architecture
   - RESTful API design following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
   - Microservices architecture with service discovery
   - API gateway implementation for routing and load balancing
   - Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
   - API versioning strategy

2. Core API Development
   - User authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0/JWT)
   - CRUD operations for all business entities
   - File upload and management endpoints
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Pagination and sorting for large datasets
   - Webhook support for real-time notifications

3. Third-Party Integrations
   - Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
   - Email services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
   - Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
   - Social media APIs (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
   - CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)

4. Security Implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
   - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration
   - API key management and rotation
   - Audit logging and monitoring

5. Documentation and Testing
   - Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI
   - Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - API performance testing and optimization
   - Error handling and status code standards
   - Developer guides and code examples

Technical Requirements:
- Backend: Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- Authentication: JWT with refresh token rotation
- Monitoring: Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Deployment: Docker containers with CI/CD pipeline
- Load Testing: Artillery or JMeter for performance validation

Deliverables:
- Complete API implementation with all endpoints
- Comprehensive documentation and developer portal
- Automated test suite with >95% code coverage
- Deployment scripts and infrastructure configuration
- Performance benchmarks and optimization report
- Security audit report and compliance documentation

Timeline: 14 weeks total
- Weeks 1-2: Requirements analysis and API design
- Weeks 3-6: Core API development and authentication
- Weeks 7-10: Third-party integrations and security
- Weeks 11-12: Testing and performance optimization
- Weeks 13-14: Documentation and deployment

Quality Assurance:
- Code review process with senior developers
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Security scanning with OWASP compliance
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Regular API health checks and uptime monitoring

Post-Launch Support:
- 3 months of bug fixes and minor enhancements
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security patches and updates
- Developer support and documentation updates
- Training sessions for internal development teams

### Machine Learning Platform
- Deploy Vertex AI for ML model training and deployment
- Implement AI Platform Notebooks for data science workflows
- Set up MLOps pipelines using Cloud Build and Cloud Functions
- Integrate with TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for ML workflows

### Analytics and Visualization
- Configure BigQuery for analytical workloads
- Set up Looker for business intelligence dashboards
- Implement Data Studio for self-service analytics
- Create real-time monitoring dashboards

### Security and Compliance
- Implement Google Cloud IAM with fine-grained access controls
- Set up VPC Security Controls for data protection
- Configure Cloud Security Command Center
- Ensure GDPR and SOC 2 compliance
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit

### Infrastructure Requirements
